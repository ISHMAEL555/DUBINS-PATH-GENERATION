# RSR Dubins Path Theory

## 1. Introduction
The RSR (Right-Start, Right-Finish) Dubins path is the shortest path that allows a vehicle with a minimum turning radius to move from an initial position to a final position. The path consists of three segments:
1. A right circular arc from the initial position.
2. A straight-line segment.
3. A right circular arc to the final position.

## 2. Path Description

### Step 1: Start Circle Center \( CR_i \)
The center of the starting circle \( CR_i \) is calculated as follows:
$$
(x_{Ri}, y_{Ri}) = (x_i + \rho \cos(\psi_i), y_i - \rho \sin(\psi_i))
$$
Where:
- \( (x_i, y_i) \) is the initial position.
- \( \psi_i \) is the initial heading.
- \( \rho \) is the minimum turning radius.

### Step 2: End Circle Center \( CR_f \)
The center of the final circle \( CR_f \) is calculated as:
$$
(x_{Rf}, y_{Rf}) = (x_f + \rho \cos(\psi_f), y_f - \rho \sin(\psi_f))
$$
Where:
- \( (x_f, y_f) \) is the final position.
- \( \psi_f \) is the final heading.

### Step 3: Angle \( \theta \)
The angle \( \theta \), which determines the orientation of the straight-line segment, is calculated as:
$$
\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y_Rf - y_Ri}{x_Rf - x_Ri}\right)
$$

### Step 4: Straight Line Length \( d \)
The length \( d \) of the straight-line segment between the two circle centers is computed as:
$$
d = \sqrt{(x_Rf - x_Ri)^2 + (y_Rf - y_Ri)^2}
$$

## 3. Path Generation

The Dubins path is generated in three segments:

1. **Arc 1: First Circle (Right Turn)**: The coordinates of the points along the first arc are calculated by rotating the initial point \( p_i \) clockwise around the circle center \( CR_i \):

2. **Straight Line Segment**: The points along the straight line segment are calculated by incrementing the previous point \( p_{n-1} \) by a fixed distance \( \Delta d \) in the direction of \( \theta \):

3. **Arc 2: Second Circle (Right Turn)**: The points along the second arc are calculated by rotating the final point of the straight-line segment around the circle center \( CR_f \):
