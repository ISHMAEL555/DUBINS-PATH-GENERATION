# Dubins Path

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Dubins paths, a method for generating the shortest path between two points given a minimum turning radius constraint. This approach is useful for autonomous vehicles and UAVs where smooth, continuous paths are required.

For a detailed description of the theory behind Dubins paths, including the mathematics and geometric principles, please see .

## Future Steps

I will add Python/ MATLAB code to implement the Dubins path algorithm in this repository. Stay tuned for updates!
