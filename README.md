# DUBINS-PATH-GENERATION
The Dubins paths are used to determine the shortest trajectory for the non-holonomic UAV model. These paths consist of three segments, which are either straight lines or arcs of circles with a specified turning radius. The generation of Dubins paths is integrated with a nonlinear, Lyapunov-based path-following control approach.
